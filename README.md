# New Generation

## Idea

We strongly believe that cosmetic products should be accessible to everyone, regardless of gender, race, or disability. However, there is currently no single source of information that is easy to find. The scattered information on the internet can be intimidating for someone starting out. Our ambition is to create a comprehensive wiki and community for all things cosmetic-related, where people can ask questions and get help from one another, create tutorials, and upload reviews. To achieve this, we need to utilize the most advanced web technologies available. Our platform will be built on an edge network, so all users around the world can have fast and reliable access. We will also be using serverless and virtualized technologies, to ensure that our system can handle a huge number of users. To provide a more personalized experience, AI technologies will be used to answer inquiries and provide translations for a large amount of content. Providing accessibility for people with disabilities is also a priority, like voice prompt for visually-impaired people, and will be taken into consideration from day one
